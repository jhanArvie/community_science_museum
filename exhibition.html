    Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed to making science accessible to all.
    Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
    The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
    We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

              Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night
              sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us.
              We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be
              seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars
              to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from
              early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, to the latest
              exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <p>
              For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
              question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
              here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
              framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.
              Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
              know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
              meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our
              Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

              Major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights
              into the great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their
              life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much
              improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine.
              Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and
              take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of
              penicillin and the first heart transplant.

              As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
              planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how
              to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
              whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the
              dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of
              species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we
              can all contribute to a brighter future.
